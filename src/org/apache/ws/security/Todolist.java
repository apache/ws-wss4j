	 * Please fill in any new items that should be done. Rename the ToDo marker
	 * to DONE if done, add your name, and some comments if necessary to keep
	 * the list uptodate.

	 * TODO: Clean up exception handling, remap to WSSecurityException, avoid
	 * generic Exception.
	 * 
	 * TODO: make Cipher provider configurable
	 * 
	 * DONE: new function to perform Certificate handover from request to
	 * response according to Kojira's explanation. Werner, checkin March, 24

	 * TODO: Better texts for the Exception, see OASIS WSS specs for recommended
	 * fault strings
