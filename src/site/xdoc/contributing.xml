<section name="Contributing to Apache WSS4J&#8482;">
<p>
As an open-source project, contributions of any kind are very welcome to Apache WSS4J.
</p>

<subsection name="Reporting bugs">
<p>
To report a bug or request a new feature, please file a <a href="issue-management.html">JIRA</a> ticket. If you do not have an account for the Apache
JIRA instance, then you will need to request one first via the <a href="mailing-lists.html">mailing lists</a>. Before filing a JIRA ticket, please discuss 
the issue on the dev or user mailing list to make sure that the issue is valid.
Please also search for the open issues in the project, or issues that are fixed
but not yet released, to make sure the issue hasn't been reported before.
</p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="Contributing Code">
<p>
Code contributions should be done as pull requests on the Apache WSS4J <a href="https://github.com/apache/ws-wss4j">GitHub repo</a>. Before contributing any
code, please run "mvn clean install" in the root directory and ensure that
all the CheckStyle and PMD checks pass, as well as all of the unit tests. 
Ideally any bug fix and new feature should have unit tests submitted as part
of the pull request.
</p>
