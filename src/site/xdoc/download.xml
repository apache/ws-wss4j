<subsection name="Verifying Releases">
<p>
When downloading from a mirror please check the SHA-512/SHA1 checksums as well
as verifying the OpenPGP compatible signature available from the main Apache
site. The <a href="https://downloads.apache.org/ws/wss4j/KEYS">KEYS</a> file
contains the public keys used for signing the release. It is recommended that a
web of trust is used to confirm the identity of these keys.
</p>
<p>
You can check the OpenPGP compatible signature with GnuPG via:
<ul>
<li>gpg --import KEYS</li>
<li>gpg --verify wss4j-*-source-release.zip.asc</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
You can check the SHA-512 digests with:
<ul>
<li>sha512sum wss4j-*-source-release.zip (and compare output to wss4j-*-source.release.zip.sha512)</li>
</ul>
